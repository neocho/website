This is my review of Balaji's **[article](https://1729.com/founding-vs-inheriting/)**. If you haven't read it already, check it out. There are some great ideas to think about!

Inheritance is both a blessing and a curse. The opportunity cost for you to get up and running is significantly less than someone who has to build something from scratch, but this could be a problem in itself. When inheriting something, whether it's wealth or an institution, you also inherit the culture, attitudes and flaws that come with it. It makes **change** extremely hard but not impossible. I think Satya Nadella is a great example of someone who inherited an institution but was able to shift culture. This shift led to a 4x increase in Microsoftâ€™s stock price. However, this is not always the case.

COVID-19 has highlighted significant faults in our social infrastructure. At the height of the pandemic, frontline workers had to turn to social media to plea for PPE supplies. They still face shortages today. Hundreds of thousands of locally owned businesses throughout the nation have shut down for good. Did PPP loans actually help these small businesses? Inherited institutions that we rely on are failing. This is because their leaders are not willing to build or change in adversity. 

For the last decade, they have been maintaining not innovating. This is a problem. Balaji describes this ethos as a read-only culture. A culture that's only replicated over time, not created. This creates an environment where people begin to lack accountability, where innovation goes to die, and progression ultimately gets stifled. What we need more are founders. Individuals who simply don't want to read-only, but are willing to build from scratch, iterate and improve. 

So, what's in store for us? What I see in the future is not a single founder, but communities that come together to build lasting institutions that innovate. These are communities filled with individuals who all exhibit the founder mentality and want to build something that they believe in. This creates an open and transparent environment where ideas and action become the only things necessary to see change. We create a culture where we encourage people to build. While I'm optimistic for this future, there are still a lot of gray areas that need to be explored.
