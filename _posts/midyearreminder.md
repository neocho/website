At the beginning of this year, I decided to list out some values that I wanted to see myself embrace more. We are halfway through the year and I thought it would be a great time to reflect on these values and see where I can improve.

Some of these values might seem trivial for others, but for me they have made a big difference in my life and help guide my daily decisions. I've only started putting more serious thought towards this at the beginning of the year. However, I've come to quickly realize that it's probably one of the most important things that I could think about.

Anyways, these are the values that I thought were most important to me at the beginning of the year. Let's see if any of that changed within the last six months.

a) Listen more, speak less  
b) Be genuinely curious  
c) Have empathy: understand different beliefs and perspectives    
d) Solve problems I want to solve and do things I want to do   
e) Focus on you  
f) Don't overthink things, move on 

I'll start off with the ones that I've been working super hard on (c, d, f). 

<strong> Have empathy: understand different beliefs and perspectives </strong>    
Having true empathy and putting personal biases aside is really challenging. We all inherently have our own personal biases and I've come to realize that more often they hinder my ability to connect with others. I read this book called Finite and Infinite Games and it has some really interesting ideas that helped me change my perspective on a lot of things. Yes, I'm not the best at it but I've noticed that I now want to try to understand other people more and not judge them so quickly. I feel like I'm beginning to be more understanding as I talk and engage with more people. This is probably the only way to improve on this! 

<strong> Solve problems I want to solve and do things I want to do </strong>  
This is something I thought I knew what I wanted to do, but actually didn't. For the last couple months I've been trying out a bunch of different things to see what I really like. I've always had this thought that it's too late to start working on something but in retrospect, it's never too late to start. I'm really enjoying this exploration phase and just trying out new things. Virgil Abloh describes this really well, "The Zig-Zag approach finds new space, linear thinking results in copies of past products". This year is about that zig zag approach and having the freedom to just explore. 

<strong> Don't overthink things, move on </strong>  
Overthinking is a bad habit of mine that I've had for years. It's caused a bunch of unecessary anxiety and stress. However, recently I've learnt to manage it through meditation. Yes, this might sound cliche but it actually works! I typically do one 10 - 15 minute meditation session in the morning. Desipte the short amount of time I put into it, it's probably one of the things that have positevely affected me the most. Now, whenever I start to overthink, I will take a break and meditate.  

Now for the ones that I've been doing pretty good on (a, b, e).

<strong> Listen more, speak less </strong>  
I'm a pretty talkative person and sometimes I get ahead of myself in conversations. For the last couple months, I've been trying hard to be more aware of others when I speak rather than just ramble on. I think this is one of those values where you just have to play it by ear. Imagine two people who think this way in a conversation, it probably won't be a great one!   

<strong> Be genuinely curious </strong>  
Being curious is something I really enjoy because as a side effect I get to try and experience a lot of different things. To me, it's like being in a buffet and I get to try a bunch of different foods. It has led to some really cool conversations and projects this year. I'm super excited to see what the second half of the year holds for me. 

<strong> Focus on you </strong>  
I have to admit that the last three years in college haven't been the most productive. Once the pandemic hit, I got used to staying indoors and that gave me a lot of time to think about my life and what I wanted from it. It was a good opportunity to really reflect on what mattered to me and formulate some sort of game plan going forward.    

The most important thing that I've realized is that most of my values stem from simply following a few daily habits. I feel like I'm on the cusp of making some significant progress in these areas, so the next couple months will be mainly focused on the challenges that I explained in the first part. While six months is a pretty long period of time, I don't think it's enough to undo years of bad habits! Sometimes, I tell myself that I'm late to start working on my values but in hindsight, there is really never a perfect time to start working on yourself than today!  

Thanks to Tarang for the edits!
